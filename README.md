# Virat-Kohli-Batting-Scores-DashBoard
This project leverages Power BI to create a dynamic and visually appealing analytics dashboard focused on the cricket performances of the legendary Virat Kohli. The dashboard allows users to gain deep insights into his batting trends, scoring patterns, and statistical highlights over time.

Key Features and What Has Been Done:
Data Collection and Preparation:

Collected historical batting data of Virat Kohli from reliable sources such as ESPN Cricinfo or Kaggle.

The data includes match-by-match performance metrics: runs scored, balls faced, strike rate, venue, opposition, match format (ODI, T20I, Test), and match date.

Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating new calculated columns for better analysis (e.g., Year, Opposition Category, Home/Away).

Interactive Dashboard Design:

Created an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard interface using Power BI visuals like bar charts, line graphs, cards, slicers, and pie charts.

Incorporated custom visuals (if applicable) to enhance readability and visual impact.

Overall Career Summary:

Displayed aggregated statistics such as:

Total Runs

Number of Innings

Centuries and Half-Centuries

Highest Score

Average and Strike Rate

Used KPI visuals and cards to showcase these metrics clearly and prominently.

Run-Scoring Trends Over Time:

Created a line chart or area chart to show how Kohli’s run tally has evolved year-by-year or series-by-series.

This visual allows users to identify peak performance years and notice any dips or trends in form.

Format-Wise Analysis (ODI, Test, T20I):

Developed a segmented view of performance across different formats.

Used slicers to filter by format, and visuals update dynamically to reflect format-specific stats like average, runs, and strike rate.

Included comparative bar charts to highlight differences between formats.

Performance Against Different Opponents:

Built visuals (e.g., stacked column or bar charts) to analyze Kohli’s performance against different international teams.

Helpful in identifying which teams he has dominated historically and against whom he has struggled.

Venue and Match Condition Analysis:

Created geographical and contextual insights:

Home vs. Away vs. Neutral venues.

Performance by location using a map visual to plot venues with run aggregates.

Performance in different countries or stadiums to assess adaptability.

Match-Wise Drill Down:

Enabled drill-through capability to go from summary stats to individual match performance.

Provides match context such as opposition, result, and Kohli’s contribution (runs, strike rate, etc.).

Century and Milestone Tracker:

Implemented a visual that tracks the number of centuries and fifties scored over time.

Included a timeline or bar chart showing year-wise breakdown of hundreds and fifties.

Filter and Slicer Interactions:

Users can filter data based on match type, year, opposition, and venue using slicers.

All visuals respond interactively, allowing a customized analytical experience.

Insights and Interpretation Section:

Added a dedicated section or tooltip that interprets key insights, such as:

“Kohli scores more consistently in ODIs compared to T20s.”

“Most centuries have come against Australia and Sri Lanka.”

“Peak batting form between 2016–2018.”

Aesthetic and UX Enhancements:

Applied consistent color themes, font styles, and layout formatting to maintain visual coherence.

Used tooltips, labels, and conditional formatting for better interactivity and insight discovery.

Sharing and Deployment:

Published the report to Power BI Service (if applicable) for cloud-based sharing.

Enabled mobile view optimization so users can access the dashboard on mobile devices.

Embedded the report into a blog or shared via link for easy distribution.
